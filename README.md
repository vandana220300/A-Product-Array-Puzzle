# A-Product-Array-Puzzle
Given an array arr[] of n integers, construct a Product Array prod[] (of same size) such that prod[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i]. 
Example :

Input: arr[]  = {10, 3, 5, 6, 2}
Output: prod[]  = {180, 600, 360, 300, 900}
3 * 5 * 6 * 2 product of other array 
elements except 10 is 180
10 * 5 * 6 * 2 product of other array 
elements except 3 is 600
10 * 3 * 6 * 2 product of other array 
elements except 5 is 360
10 * 3 * 5 * 2 product of other array 
elements except 6 is 300
10 * 3 * 6 * 5 product of other array 
elements except 2 is 900
